How to play:

    SETUP:
    
        1. Find the folder named "Game Files"
        2. Run the file named "PeasantsAscension.exe" in this folder
        3. Play the game
        
    PLAYING THE GAME:
    
        Peasant's Ascension is very simple. After creating a character,
        you are placed on the world map with minimal equipment. 
        To use a command, type in the command and then hit 
        Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS X) to send it. 
        Available commands are (almost) always listed on the 
        screen, and can often be shortened to just the first 
        letter (i.e. "x" or "e" instead of "exit"). Sometimes,
        such as on the title screen, the command is listed as 
        a word with the first letter in brackets (i.e. "[P]lay").
        In this case, just input the letter inside the brackets.
        Other times, the command is simply a number with the 
        command located next to it. (i.e. [1] View Inventory).
        Simply input the number in the brackets next to the 
        command you want to use.
----------------------------------------------------
What is the "Adventure Name"?

    When creating your character, the game will ask you to input
    an Adventure Name. The purpose of this is to give a name to the
    folder in which the save files are located. This is why there are
    so many limitations to what you can name adventures, as certain 
    symbols are not allowed as folder names on certain OSes. To prevent
    problems, the game only allows alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
    as well as the underscore-character ( _ ) and the hyphen-character ( - ).
    In addition, the game does not allow files to be named "" (aka nothing).
    If you wish to include these characters in your Adventure Name, you will
    have to use a file/directory viewer to rename the folder to want you want,
    assuming that your OS allows those characters.
----------------------------------------------------
What to do if the game crashes:

    If the game crashes, the error will be logged in a file named 
    "error_log.out". If you encounter an error, the message will be 
    located there, and the file can be sent to me (stephenbcenter@gmail.com) 
    so I can fix the problem. The only information located in the file is
    an error message and nothing else. (If you want to verify this, you can
    open the file using a program like TextWrangler, Notepad++, or Sublime 
    Text.) I appreciate your help!
----------------------------------------------------
How to change the settings:

    By default, the game saves its files in a folder called "Save Files",
    located in the Game Files directory. It also defaults to playing all
    music/sound-effects at full volume. These can both be changed by 
    editing a set of variables in a file called "settings.cfg", located in
    the "Peasant's Ascension" folder. This file can be opened using a program like
    TextWrangler, Notepad++, or Sublime Text. Instructions on changing these
    are located in the file.

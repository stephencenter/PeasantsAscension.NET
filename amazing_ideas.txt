PEASANT-RPG GOALS

-- v1.0.0 update plans -- 
[x] Add several new monster items

[x] Rewrite the monster attack function by separating the damage formula from the AI

[x] Make a standardized "Unit" class that the Monster and PlayableCharacter classes will inherit from

[x] Move all PCU and Monster information to a new units.py file

[x] Rework the entire world.py file, parts of the towns.py file, and some dialogue from the npcs.py file to use a custom tile-based world system

[x] Rework monster leveling to be specific to each tile instead of based off a scaling distance formula

[x] Rework a lot of the code to be more modular, so that the game engine could be used by other people

[x] Rework the battle system so that it supports multiple enemies.

[x] Rework magic so that it doesn't always go first in battle. This would be a much-needed nerf to mages.

[x] Rework Conversations and Quests to be cleaner and more functional

[x] Fix the drop system at the end of battle to work better with the multi-monster battle system.

[x] Separate PCU/Monster element attributes into an offensive (off_element) and defensive (def_element) element. 
	[x] This is similar to what was previously in the game, where weapons could have their own unique element. 
		The main difference is that this will be significantly easier to work with.
		
[x] Revamp saving
	[x] Creating a character should immediately save the game, so that if you decide to quit before you get to a town, you can still 
		reload your game.
	[x] Create a save_load.py file that handles saving and loading the game to help clear out the main.py file
	[x] When you save the game, the save files should first be placed into a temp folder instead of immediately overwriting the originals. 
		This would prevent bugs from accidentally corrupting a save file.
	[x] Make the game generate a .txt file containing a disclaimer about manually editing save files. 
	
[x] Rename NPCClass to npcs, rename npcs to dialogue. Move all NPC stuff to npcs, move all dialogue stuff to dialogue.

[x] Remove resting and location ascii art
	[x] I really disliked these two mechanics. Resting was overpowered and honestly unnecessary with the availability of healing spells and potions,
		and location ascii art was too over-the-top and didn't really look that good.

[x] Automatic attack redirection if target unit dies before attack goes off
		
[x] Revamp the inventory to show one instance of each item, with quantity to the right

[x] Make settings changeable in-game

[x] Support for multiple status effects, including mundane things like "Alive" or "Disarmed"

[x] Redo all item descriptions to be multi-line

[x] Alchemy
	[x] Buy an "Pocket Alchemy Lab" and use it to bring up the Alchemy menu
	[x] In this menu, all items in your inventory tagged as alchemy ingredients (i.e. miscellaneous items dropped by enemies)
	    will show up. Select any three of them to make a potion. 
	[x] Each ingredient has a specific "flavor", meaning that it can be used to make a certain kind of potion.
	    When you select your ingredients, the game uses RNG to determine what kind of potion it should be.
		Use three ingredients each with different flavors, and there's a 33.33% chance for the potion to end up as each flavor.
		Use two ingredients of the same flavor, and one of a different flavor, and there's a 66.67% and 33.33% chance respectively.
		etc.
	[x] These potions have unique effects only obtainable through alchemy
		
[x] Fix the tool items:
	[x] Fix the shovel
	[x] Fix the fast travel boots
	[x] Remove the Divining Rod
	[x] Add a music box that plays music from your computer
	[x] Remove the compass
	[x] Add new item: Monster Encyclopedia - Identical to the Rangers' old "Scout" ability, without the crit bonus.
		Can only be used during battle.
		
[x] Enemy Revamp
	[x] Give each type of enemy their own unique stats, elements, drops, attack messages, etc.
	[x] Rework monster spawning to not be based off biome
	[x] Make it so if you encounter an enemy on the overworld, you have a % chance to "sneak up" on them based on your perception, 
		giving you a choice on whether to attack or ignore the enemy.
		
[x] Custom dialogue for accepting/turning down a quest

[ ] Custom music for towns

[ ] Add more combat options:	
	[ ] Kick
		[ ] Is an alternative to the attack option, with a few changes
			[ ] Kicking does [10 + Strength] damage, ignoring the players attack stat
			[ ] Kicking ALWAYS does physical damage, even if the player's class normal attacks do magic/pierce damage
			[ ] Kicking makes the user go last, because kicking requires the player to get closer
			[ ] Can be augmented by an accessory called the "Steal Toe Boots"
				[ ] Triple the damage done by kicks [3*(10 + Strength)]
				[ ] Lowers the accuracy of kicks by 10%
				[ ] Lowers the speed of the user (all actions, not just kicks) by 10%
	[ ] Throw items
		[ ] Does [5 + Dexterity] damage, ignoring the player's attack stat
		[ ] There are special throwable items such as Throwing Knives, Rocks, and Darts have specific damage values [Damage + Dexterity]
		[ ] Throwing deals pierce damage
		[ ] Can be augmented by an accessory called "The Throw Akimbo"
			[ ] Allows the player to throw two items
	[ ] Defend
		[ ] Doubles the player's defense stats for 1 turning
	[ ] Pass/Wait
		[ ] The player does nothing - no attacks, no stat increases, etc.
		[ ] +2 AP regen on wait turn instead of +1

[ ] Additional class-independent use for attributes
	[ ] INT - ???
	[ ] CON - ???
	[ ] WIS - Bonus Healing Power
	[ ] STR - Bonus Kick Power
	[ ] DEX - Bonus Throw Power
	[ ] CHA - Better deals at shops
	[ ] PER - Ignore enemy battles
	
[ ] Randomly Generated Dungeons
	[X] Dungeons would be randomized mazes that are generated upon entering them.
	[X] Each province would have one dungeon that can be entered at any time.
	[ ] The dungeons are completely optional to beating the game and finishing every quest, 
		although there will be a stat called "unique dungeons completed" that would probably have to be maxed out to be considered 100% completion
	[ ] Each floor of the dungeon will have one item, randomized from a list of dungeon-exclusive items (as well as gold and alchemy ingredients)
	[ ] Each floor will have one mini-boss, who upon killing will drop a key that lets you unlock the door to the next floor
	[ ] The final floor will have a true boss that is much stronger than the minibosses and will unlock a stairway to the entrance when defeated.

[ ] Make a tool that auto-creates 3x3 cells, as well as houses for towns

[ ] Make it so Potions can be used on allies

[ ] Fix all of the quests that have been broken due to all the above changes

[ ] Rewrite the credits, lore, and back-story

[ ] Add back in the Anti-Blood Squad, now that multi-monster battles are a thing.		
	
-- Potential Ideas -- 
[ ] Add races (Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, etc)
	[ ] These races would have a slight effect on the players stats
	[ ] Also add a PlayableCharacter.generate_lore() method that generates 2-3 pseudo-random paragraphs based on the player's class and race.
		The lore would be stored in a player_object.lore attribute, and would be viewable from the [P]arty section of the menu.

[ ] Randomly generated overworld cells
	[ ] Would NOT be a maze, should ideally not be difficult to explore
	
[ ] Random Events in towns:
	[ ] Angry Mobs
	[ ] Monster Attacks
	
[ ] Passive abilities
	[ ] Each class would have one of them. Their affects would occur in every battle without requiring additional input.
	
[ ] Boss descriptions - A paragraph of text that "sets the scene" for boss battles. Eerie music plays during this time.
